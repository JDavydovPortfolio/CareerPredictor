A project utilizing custom-built **AI** and **Machine Learning** techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to predict graduate job placements.  
This work highlights expertise in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and building predictive models to uncover actionable insights.

---
## **Overview**

This project analyzes factors influencing job placements for graduates, including academic performance, specialization, and work experience. Built using **Python** in an interactive **Jupyter Notebook** environment, it leverages powerful libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning. Using logistic regression, the model classifies students as `Placed` or `Not Placed`, providing a data-driven approach to understanding placement trends.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and handled missing values.
  - Addressed outliers using the IQR method with an adjusted multiplier.
  - Converted categorical variables to numeric representations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized trends in placement outcomes by specialization, work experience, and academic scores.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**:
  - Built a logistic regression model with a testing accuracy of 93%.
  - Evaluated performance using confusion matrices and classification metrics.

---

## **Results**

- **Training Accuracy**: 100%  
  *Explanation*: The small dataset size led to perfect training accuracy, but the modelâ€™s generalizability is validated by testing metrics.
- **Testing Accuracy**: 93%  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher academic scores correlate strongly with placement success.
  - Graduates with work experience and specific specializations have higher placement rates.

---

## **Visualizations**

- Histograms of academic scores categorized by placement outcomes.
- Bar charts showing placement trends by specialization and work experience.
- Confusion matrices for training and testing datasets.
