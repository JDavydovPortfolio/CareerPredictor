# CareerPredictor

A machine learning project designed to predict job placement outcomes for graduates using logistic regression. 
This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to uncover actionable insights.

---

## **Overview**

This project analyzes factors influencing job placements for graduates, including academic performance, specialization, and work experience. Using logistic regression, the model classifies students as `Placed` or `Not Placed`, providing a data-driven approach to understanding placement trends.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and handled missing values.
  - Addressed outliers using the IQR method with an adjusted multiplier.
  - Converted categorical variables to numeric representations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized trends in placement outcomes by specialization, work experience, and academic scores.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**:
  - Built a logistic regression model with a testing accuracy of 93%.
  - Evaluated performance using confusion matrices and classification metrics.

---

## **Results**

- **Training Accuracy**: 100%  
  *Explanation*: The small dataset size led to perfect training accuracy, but the modelâ€™s generalizability is validated by testing metrics.
- **Testing Accuracy**: 93%  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher academic scores correlate strongly with placement success.
  - Graduates with work experience and specific specializations have higher placement rates.

---

## **Visualizations**

- Histograms of academic scores categorized by placement outcomes.
- Bar charts showing placement trends by specialization and work experience.
- Confusion matrices for training and testing datasets.
